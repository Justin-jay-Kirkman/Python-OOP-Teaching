# Python OOP Training

This project was created in mind of teaching others OOP principals in python as well as refreshing my own skills.
Once finished the steps on learning should be followed in this order.

1. Inheritance
2. Encapsulation 
3. Abstraction 
4. Polymorphism

I'm still cleaning up the structure of the project and organizing the structure of the project, so expect it to change.
